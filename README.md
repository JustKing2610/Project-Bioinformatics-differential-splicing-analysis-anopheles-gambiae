# Differential splicing analysis of chemosensory genes from antennae and maxillary palps in anopheles colluzzi and quadriannulatus 

An overview of the tools, scripts and commands used to recreate this pipeline

## Description

In this research we provide alternatively spliced gene variants that may be responsible for the human host preference in An. coluzzii. RNA-seq data generated from the antennae and maxillary palp of both An. coluzzii and An. quadriannulatus by G. Athrey et all. will be used in this research. The main goal of this project is to look into the alternative splicing of genes expressed in the antennae and maxillary palps. By finding certain splice variants which are more present in one of the 2 species analysed, we provide the necessary information to combat the spread of malaria since these alternative splice variants might contribute to the host seeking behaviour. To reach this goal we will use several tools for quality control of the raw RNA-seq data, filtering and trimming the raw data, followed by tools to detect alternative splice events. The tools used for this research are FASTQC, Trimmomatic, TopHat2, StringTie2, Kallisto, Samtools, SUPPA2 and DEseq2. Using these tools, the alternative splicing and differential expression can be detected in the RNA-seq data.
